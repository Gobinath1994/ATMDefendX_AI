Script to Download Clean ATM Front View Images

This script uses the `bing_image_downloader` package to fetch clean,
front-facing images of ATMs and organize them into a target directory
for later use in training or visual comparison.

Steps:
1. Download ~50 images from Bing using the search query "ATM front view".
2. Move those images into `data/clean_atms/` directory.
3. Clean up any temporary folders created during download.
